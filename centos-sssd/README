This derivative centos:8.4.2105 docker image with sssd package
can be used for applications that rely on PAM to authenticate to
LDAP servers, including MS Active Directory. The image requires
proper /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, /etc/pam.d/system-auth and 
/etc/ssl/certs/ldap-ca.crt files to be mounted at runtime either 
via docker run -v option or k8s secret volumes.
Thus, it is possible to run PAM-dependant application with LDAP
authentication without commercial Quest software in centos docker
containers.
One example of such application is Rstudio non-Pro edition, which
can only authenticate users via PAM.
